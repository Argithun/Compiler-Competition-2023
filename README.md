Hi!

This is a compiler that compiles the Sysy language (a subset of the C language pack) into LLVM IR and finally into ARM assembly instructions.

This project won the second prize in the compiler design track of the China University Student System Competence Competition in 2023.

Feel free to refer to or learn from it!
